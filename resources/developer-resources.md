* Validator Tools
  * [Fast Stellar Core Catch Up](https://github.com/Lobstrco/stellar-core-parallel-catchup-py) - Starting a full stellar core validator from scratch takes a while, as the node needs to download and process a lot of data during the "Catch up" phase. The catching up phase usually takes more than a month. This script helps to make the process significantly shorter, as it allows to perform the catch up of multiple ledgers blocks in parallel.
  * [Parallel Stellar Core Catchup](https://github.com/satoshipay/stellar-core-parallel-catchup) - Sync a full Stellar validator node \(including full history\) as fast as possible. Split the big ledger into small chunks of size CHUNK\_SIZE. Run a catchup for the chunks in parallel with WORKERS worker processes. Stitch together the resulting database and history archive.
